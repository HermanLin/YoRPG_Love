#=====FEATURE EXPLANATIONS=====
#	-Currency and Potions-
#Currency and potions are both kept track of as variables
#for the character that is created. Whenever you kill a 
#monster, you get 20 Gold. In order to get potions, you 
#need to kill a monster first, then you will be able to
#use the store menu
#	-The Store-
#The store menu shows you how much money you have 
#available on your character based on the currency variable.
#Then you have the option to enter 1 to buy a potion or 
#enter 2 to leave the store. If you don't have enough money
#to buy a potion, you are told that you don't have enough and
#then you have the option to leave the store by entering 2.
#	-The Boss Monster-
#The boss monster is a subclass of Monster.java. Therefore, 
#it has the same variables as a normal monster would, except
#that the boss monster has significantly stronger stats to it.
#If you manage to kill the boss, you have fully completed the
